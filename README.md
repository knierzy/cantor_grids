**Cantor Grids: A New 2D Visualization Method for Four-Parameter Systems, with Exemplary Applications in Garnet Chemistry and Soil Classification**

## Overview

This repository provides a framework for the graphical representation and analysis of four-component systems using customized Cantor grids. The approach is designed to minimize spatial overlap between data points and maximize the resolution of subgroups or classifications within complex, compositional datasets.


The project comprises modular Python scripts labeled `C1` to `C8`:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `C1.py` | Generates Cartesian prodct for four compositional parameters.|
| `C2.py` | Constructs and exports convex hulls derived from Cartesian products.|
| `C3.py` | Compares two spreadsheet datasets using the first four columns to identify identical records.|
| `C4.py` | Visualizes scattered garnet subfields in a Cantor diagram based on their end-member compositions. |
| `C5.py` | Visualizes scattered garnet subfields in a Cantor Diagram with an additional colorbar for interpreting samples from Pernegg. |
| `C6.py` | Cantor diagram for the Austrian soil texture classification including humus as fourth component. |
| `C7.py` | Cantor diagram with synthetic data with displayed Available Water Content (colorbar)
| `C8.py` | Cantor diagram with soil samples of district Kirchdorf with displayed Available Water Content as halo (colorbar). |
