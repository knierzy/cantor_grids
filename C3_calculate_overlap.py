# Compares two Excel datasets based on the first four columns to identify identical entries.
# Each row is treated as a 4-component tuple (as strings) and exact matches are calculated.
# The script computes the number and relative frequency of identical rows in each dataset.
# Useful for identifying data overlaps or redundancies between two datasets.
# In this example, the input files refer to greenschist and blueschist compositions, respectively.
